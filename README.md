# Diary test app

## Description

This is a small diary app built with Expo and Tamagui made for a technical interview.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the app.

   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   npx expo run:ios
   ```

   These commands will build the native app for Android and iOS. Run it every time you add a new native dependency or when you want to install the app on a new device.

3. Start the app by launching the Metro bundler

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

> Warning: This app does not work on with Expo GO, step 2 is required.
